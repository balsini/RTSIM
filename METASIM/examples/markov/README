MARKOV EXAMPLE

This example models a simple markov chain. This is just an example of
how it is possible to use the basic classes provided by MetaSim for
modeling a discrete event simulation. 

FILES

markov.hpp		definition of the main classes
markov.cpp       	the example file
makefile	

COMPILING

After compiling the metasim library, enter the example/markov directory
and simply type make. An executable file (markov under Linux and
markov.exe under cygwin) will be produced. 

RUNNING

The program will simulate a markov chain composed by three states. The 
probability of changing state follows an exponential distribution. 

The program executes 29 simulation runs and computes the average interval
of time spent in state 2 and in state 1 and the 98% confidence interval.
