QUEUE EXAMPLE

This example models a simple M/M/1 queue. This is just an example of
how it it possible to use the basic classes provided by MetaSim for
modeling a discrete event simulation.

COMPILING

After compiling the metasim library, enter the example/queue directory
and simply type make. An executable file (queue under Linux and
queue.exe under cygwin) will be produced. 

RUNNING

The program will ask you for two parameters: lambda (the avg service
time) and mu (the avg interarrival time). Recall that in a M/M/1 queue
the service times and the interarrivals are both exponentially
distributed. 

The program execute 20 simulation runs and compute the average queue
lenght and the 98% confidence interval. 

If you insert:

lambda = 4
mu = 8

the result should be:

>  The average length is 1.01568
>  with a 98% confidence interval of 0.0363476 

Recall the the formula for the average queue lenght is

	avg = rho / (1 - rho)

where 

	rho = lambda / mu

In this example, 20 simulation runs are done and every simulation run
lasts for 50000 ticks: the results of the first 10000 ticks are not
considered for computing the mean. If you want more accurate
results, you must make longer simulations, or more simulation runs.
