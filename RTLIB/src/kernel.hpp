        \ingroup kernels

        An implementation of a real-time single processor kernel.
        It contains :

        - a ponter to one CPU

        - a pointer to a Scheduler, which implements the
        scheduling policy;

        - a pointer to a Resource Manager, which is responsable
        for resource access related operations and thus implements
        a resource allocation policy;

        - the set of task handled by this kernel.
      
        This implementation is quite general: it lets the user of
        this class the freedom to adopt any scheduler derived form
        Scheduler and a resorce manager derived from ResManager
        or no resorce manager at all.

        It is up to the instruction class to implemet the correct
        duration of its execution by asking the kernel of its task
        the speed of the processor on whitch it's scheduled.

        We will probably have to derive from this class to
        implement static partition and mixed task allocation to
        CPU.
